My approach is based on two fundamental assumptions. The first assumption is that prices are given in a day-ahead market.This means that prices are revealed one day before the actual day of scheduling in the given market. In this context, the model takes even more simplistic approach assuming that prices for the next day are revealed at the end of the current day. Therefore the whole three-year period is divided into daily sub-periods and optimisation is performed sequentially one day at a time. The second fundamental assumption is about the engineering limitations of energy storage: it is assumed that storage device is not able to charge and discharge at the same time. This means that it is not able to utilise arbitrage opportunity across different markets but it is able to utilise arbitrage opportunuty within a single market by buying and selling electricity at different times. Worth mentioning that if storage commits to charging in Market 3 (where prices are given daily), it can only charge in Markets 1 and 2, if it chooses to. Similarly, if storage commits to discharging in Market 3, it can only discharge in Markets 1 and 2.
